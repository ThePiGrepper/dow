Initializing a Mirrored Repository

$ mkdir <mirror-dir>
$ cd <mirror-dir>
$ ln -s <this-dir> srcdir
$ ./srcdir/dow-init.sh mock


Generating Modification Commits

Go to data repository (<mirror-dir>/data).
Commit and branch as usual (merges not supported).


Generating Synchronization Commits

Go to versions repository (<mirror-dir>/versions).
Create files. Fill them with valid version numbers.
  * Inspect the mock repository (<mirror-dir>/mock_repo) to see what versions
    are available for each file.
Commit and branch as usual.


Generating Synchronization Merges

Just use the option --no-commit when invoking git-merge. Then commit with
git-commit, so that the commit hooks are invoked.


Working with a plain Git repository

Clone and pull from the data repository as usual.

$ git clone <mirror-dir>/data <local-repo>

When you want to publish your work, call a pull script from the data repository:

$ cd <mirror-dir>/data
$ ../utils/git_pull.sh <local-repo> <branch>

The script will fetch your branch and simulate modification commits from your
changes. If a commit fails to apply (e.g., because it modifies an outdated
file), the branch is not updated.


Expected Results

Data repository (<mirror-dir>/data) should contain a history isomorph to the one
in the versions repository. File contents in the data repository should reflect
the version numbers used as file contents in the versions repository, as mapped
by the mock repository.


Known Issues

* Commits with files given on the command line (e.g. "git commit -- file") are
  not supported. Apply the changes to the index and then commit without these
  arguments.

* Modification merges are not currently supported.
