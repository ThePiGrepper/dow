Initializing a Mirrored Repository

$ mkdir <test-dir>
$ cd <test-dir>
$ ln -s <path-to-gm_draft> gm_draft
$ ./gm_draft/gm-init.sh


Generating Synchronization Commits

Go to versions repository (<test-dir>/versions).
Create files. Fill them with imaginary version numbers.
Commit as usual.
Generate more commits.
Try creating new (possibly orphan) branches.


Generating Synchronization Merges

Just use the option --no-commit when invoking git-merge. Then commit with
git-commit, so that the commit hooks are invoked.


Expected Results

Data repository (<test-dir>/data) should contain a history isomorph to the one
in the versions repository. File contents in the data repository should reflect
the version numbers used as file contents in the versions repository.
